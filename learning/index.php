                <h3>Soldering</h3>
                <p>Soldering is joining of metals through melting one of them, or using a filler metal to join the
                    metals together. Building a circuit board usually involves some form of soldering in order to join
                    all supplemental components onto the board. This workshop will include the basics on how to
                    correctly and safely solder boards in order to produce a functioning circuit. This is useful for
                    those interested in electronics and in Senior Design.
