                <h2>EAGLE Training Session</h2>
                <p>This training session will cover the basics of EAGLE, an electrical board schematic and layout tool. The training session is split into three parts, that will teach how to create schematics, board layouts, and parts. No prior knowledge is required. The first session will be held this Thursday, in Physics 203 at 6:30 PM. Additional details below:</p>
