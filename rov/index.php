                    Purdue ROV competed in Federal Way, WA at the Weyerhaueser King County Aquatic Center from June 21st
                    to June 23rd. In the first year under captain Alex Ruffino, the team placed 18th out of 28
                    registered team, and won the Guts and Glory Award for overcoming technical hardship with resolve.
                    Power issues prevented ROV Cetacean from as well as expected, but several technical advances were
                    made with the ROV. A new stabilization system made the ROV easier to pilot, and a magnetic slip
                    coupling quick release system revolutionized tool design. We look forward to the 2018-19 season. See

                The Remotely Operated underwater Vehicle (ROV) team was founded as a committee within Purdue IEEE
                Student Organization in 2008 with a small but dedicated group of five students. Today, the team's
                mission is to foster technical and professional skills of its members by designing, constructing, and
                testing an innovative underwater vehicle to compete in the MATE Center International ROV Competition.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                The ROV team is comprised of both engineering and non-engineering students working collaboratively on a
                hands-on project from the vehicle's design and prototyping phase, to its construction and testing, and
                ultimately competition performance. The team fosters a multidisciplinary spirit so that the best ideas
                may come forth. In addition to the mission, the MATE competition also requires a professional
                presentation, public display poster, and technical documentation.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                Because the vehicle requires excellence in design, construction, and presentation, the team members are
                themselves multidisciplinary collaborators and experts in their own discipline. Members learn to
                communicate clearly with each other and with clients while managing their own project responsibilities.
                Through various outreach events during the year, the team aims to inspire future generations to enter
                STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields.
