                    The Remotely Operated underwater Vehicle (ROV) team was founded as a committee within Purdue IEEE Student Organization in 2008 with a small but dedicated group of five students. Today, the team's mission is to foster technical and professional skills of its members by designing, constructing, and testing an innovative underwater vehicle to compete in the MATE Center International ROV Competition.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="text-justify">
                The ROV team is comprised of both engineering and non-engineering students working collaboratively on a hands-on project from the vehicle's design and prototyping phase, to its construction and testing, and ultimately competition performance. The team fosters a multidisciplinary spirit so that the best ideas may come forth. In addition to the mission, the MATE competition also requires a professional presentation, public display poster, and technical documentation.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                Because the vehicle requires excellence in design, construction, and presentation, the team members are themselves multidisciplinary collaborators and experts in their own discipline. Members learn to communicate clearly with each other and with clients while managing their own project responsibilities. Through various outreach events during the year, the team aims to inspire future generations to enter STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields.
