            <p> The ROV Team began its ninth season with over 60 new-member applicants. The top 29 applicants were accepted to join the 30 returning veterans in what will be the the
                strongest team to date! Our team looks forward to the summer 2017 competition in Long Beach, CA and are eagerly preparing for first place!</p>

                <h2 class="text-center">About The ROV Team</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">The Remotely Operated underwater Vehicle (ROV) team was founded as a committee within Purdue IEEE Student
                    Organization in 2008 with a small but dedicated group of five students. Today, the team's mission is to foster
                    technical and professional skills of its members by designing, constructing, and testing an innovative
                    underwater vehicle to compete in the MATE Center International ROV Competition.
                </p>

                <p class="text-justify">The ROV team is comprised of both engineering and non-engineering students working collaboratively on a
                    hands-on project from the vehicle's design and prototyping phase, to its construction and testing, and ultimately
                    competition performance. The team fosters a multidisciplinary spirit so that the
                    best ideas may come forth. In addition to the mission, the MATE competition also requires a professional
                    presentation, public display poster, and technical documentation.
                </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Because the vehicle requires excellence in
                    design, construction, and presentation, the team members are themselves multidisciplinary collaborators and
                    experts in their own discipline. Members learn to communicate clearly
                    with each other and with clients while managing their own project responsibilities. Through various outreach events
                    during the year, the team aims to inspire future generations to enter STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering,
                    and Mathematics) fields.
