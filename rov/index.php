					The 2020-2021 season marks a unique season for the team as they try to continue
					operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Heading into this season, the team
					experienced change with several of the leads for technical teams assuming their
					role for the first time. The team has taken the foundation of X12 that was
					constructed the prior season before the suspension and is building upon that to
					create the next iteration of the ROV, X13. Two of the main improvements planned
					for X13 are a more accessible yet powerful electronics design utilizing Power
					over Ethernet and a software system leveraging more powerful hardware for a
					more capable ROV. This season we have two prominent R&D projects with the
					development of custom thrusters, rather than relying on the narrow choice
					presented by Blue Robotics and the development of welded enclosures aimed at
					improving resource efficiency. While there are still restrictions in place at
					Purdue that alter the progress of the ROV, the team is continuing to progress
					while ensuring that theyâ€™re following all Protect Purdue guidelines to
					maintain a safe working environment. The team is proud of its progress so
					far and is excited to see its hard work take form.

                The Remotely Operated underwater Vehicle (ROV) team was founded as a committee within Purdue IEEE
                Student Organization in 2008 with a small but dedicated group of five students. Today, the team's
                mission is to foster technical and professional skills of its members by designing, constructing, and
                testing an innovative underwater vehicle to compete in the MATE Center International ROV Competition.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                The ROV team is comprised of both engineering and non-engineering students working collaboratively on a
                hands-on project from the vehicle's design and prototyping phase, to its construction and testing, and
                ultimately competition performance. The team fosters a multidisciplinary spirit so that the best ideas
                may come forth. In addition to the mission, the MATE competition also requires a professional
                presentation, public display poster, and technical documentation.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                Because the vehicle requires excellence in design, construction, and presentation, the team members are
                themselves multidisciplinary collaborators and experts in their own discipline. Members learn to
                communicate clearly with each other and with clients while managing their own project responsibilities.
                Through various outreach events during the year, the team aims to inspire future generations to enter
                STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields.
