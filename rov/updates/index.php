                Purdue ROV competed in Houston, TX from June 22 - 25, 2016 at NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Lab! Thanks for all who supported our team at the competition and throughout the year! We had a wonderful technical presentation, an excellent poster, and great technical documentation. We had some electronics issues during the mission runs but were still able to place 13th internationally! Additionally, Kyle Rakos was awarded with the Flying Fish award for his passion and demonstrated leadership in the field!  We will soon add more details under Past Seasons and Pictures!
