			<h3>2020 Suspension</h3>
            <p><em>July, 2019</em></p>
            <div>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The 2019-2020 season marked an exciting and bustling new season for the team. The team experienced its fourth change in captaincy with Grant Geyer heading the team. 
					Also new are many of the leads for technical teams. The team pursued many new designs and approaches toward making X12, in addition to several refinements from ROV <i>Remora</i>. 
					The R&D department found new ethernet camera that were more reliable and PoE compatible for an nearly independent camera system. 
					The major mechanical improvements include a faster and effective method of using a ring clamp to seal the logic electronics tube and 
					the use of 3D prints to house thrusters and to provide buoyancy in conjuntion with expanding marine foam. 
					With the suspension of all Purdue activities and the cancellation of the MATE competition, the team is now working at a very limited capacity to prepare ROV X12 for a pool test when available. 
					The team is excited to see its hard work come to completion when normal activities resume.

			<h3>2019 Competition</h3>
            <p><em>July, 2019</em></p>
            <div>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The year 2019 marked an improvement for the team, with many leaders returning to their positions.
					The team improved 5 places to finish 13th at the competition and had the second best technical report.
					The team maintained a similar size of students. In 2019, the competition was hosted in Kingsport, TN by Eastman.
					The team aimed for an ambitious design, changing the tools system to use pneumatics, the electrical system to CAN and ethernet cameras,
					and the software system to Robot Operating System. These switches made ROV Remora more robust, but delayed testing and made integration more difficult.
					The team is very proud of its achievements and excited to see where the upcoming season goes under the new leadership.

                    Purdue ROV competed in Federal Way, WA at the Weyerhaueser King County Aquatic Center from June 21st
                    to June 23rd. In the first year under captain Alex Ruffino, the team placed 18th out of 28
                    registered team, and won the Guts and Glory Award for overcoming technical hardship with resolve.
                    Power issues prevented ROV Cetacean from as well as expected, but several technical advances were
                    made with the ROV. A new stabilization system made the ROV easier to pilot, and a magnetic slip
                    coupling quick release system revolutionized tool design. We look forward to the 2018-19 season. See

                    Purdue ROV competed in Houston, TX from June 22 - 25, 2016 at NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Lab! Thanks
                    for all who supported our team at the competition and throughout the year! We had a wonderful
                    technical presentation, an excellent poster, and great technical documentation. We had some
                    electronics issues during the mission runs but were still able to place 13th internationally!
                    Additionally, Kyle Rakos was awarded with the Flying Fish award for his passion and demonstrated
                    leadership in the field! We will soon add more details under Past Seasons and Pictures!
