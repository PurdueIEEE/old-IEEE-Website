                <h3 class="text-center">An incredible accomplishment by the Purdue University IEEE ROV Team!</h3>
                <p>For those who aren't familiar with the ROV industry, ROV stands for Remotely Operated Vehicle. Almost always, an ROV is an underwater vehicle designed to complete tasks that are too dangerous, too boring, or too difficult for a human diver to accomplish. ROVs are piloted remotely with signals sent through a tether and have made it as deep as 35,000 feet below the sea floor. By percent growth, it is one of the fastest growing engineering industries.</p>
                <p>The Purdue IEEE ROV team is dedicated to competing in the worldâ€™s largest ROV competition, the MATE (Marine Advanced Technology Education Center) competition. The mission this year focused on simulating submarine rescue ROVs that can deliver fresh air, deliver emergency supplies, survey a submarine for damage, and mate with an escape hatch in a worst-case scenario that submarines need to be brought on-board the ROV.</p>
                <p>Including the entry level Ranger class and more technical Explorer class (Purdue choose to compete in the Explorer class despite the fact that most universities are placed in the Ranger class their first year), there were over 340 team from around the world!</p>
                <p>Purdue competed on June 25th and placed 5th overall internationally! The team was also the only rookie team to place in the top 10!<br>This put Purdue ahead of such universities as MIT, Georgia Tech, UNC, Embry-Riddle, and even the defending champions from Newfoundland!</p>
                <p>Thanks to all those at Purdue who have helped us get to where we are!<br>If you'd like to see a video of ROV <em>Osprey</em> in action, please click on the following link: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrX_OsVcW4g">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrX_OsVcW4g</a></p>
                <p>Purdue will be returning to next year's competition which will be in Hawaii!<br>Please forward this to anyone you may think would be interested!</p>
                <p>Thanks for your interest!<br>Seth Baklor<br>Team Captain<br>Sophomore, Industrial Engineering</p>

                <h2 class="text-center">Abstract and Awards</h2><br>
                <p>The Purdue IEEE ROV Team received 5th Place in the 2009 MATE (Marine Advanced Technology Education) Center International ROV Competition in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts. The team was the only rookie among the returning teams in the top 10, edging out even the defending champions.</p>
                <p>ROV <em>Osprey</em>, the first creation of the new Purdue University IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) ROV Team, has been built to accomplish and exceed the 2009 MATE International ROV Competition mission requirements. The vehicle was designed with a focus on overall reliability, design simplicity, and speed/agility. All of these goals were to be accomplished within a predetermined final vehicle cost of approximately $2,000 (not including the cost of research/testing or the cost of going to the competition).</p>
                <p>The vehicle is designed to aid crippled submarines by surveying them for damage, delivering Emergency Life Support System (ELSS) pods, delivering fresh air, and rescuing crew in the extreme condition that it becomes necessary. Designing submarine rescue vehicles is a crucial and exciting part of the ROV world the team is proud to have experienced.</p>
                <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4fhEqCNKuhBaW1acmYyQndhbkk">This report</a> will present the creation and evolution of ROV <em>Osprey</em> and the Purdue team as a whole. Having just been formed, the team has overcome a lack of knowledge, experience, available tools, and support to become better engineers.</p>
