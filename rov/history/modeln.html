                <h2 class="text-center">PURDUE STUDENTS COMPETE IN INTERNATIONAL ROV COMPETITION</h2><br>
                <h3 class="text-center">Aiming for First Place Internationally with Brand New Vehicle</h3>
                <p>The Purdue IEEE ROV Team has been competing in the MATE (Marine Advanced Technology Education) Center's ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) International Competition for four years already. This year they are looking for a win with their latest innovative ROV from the clever minds of its engineers, the <em>Model N</em>.</p>
                <p>The MATE competition pits school teams against each other to see who can create the most efficient, well-designed, and cost-effective underwater robots to complete an assigned mission. The mission changes every year and has included submarine rescue missions, oil well capping operations and underwater volcano exploration. This year's mission from the MATE Center focuses on seafloor observation networks. The tasks revolve around deploying new instruments and servicing old equipment in one such network designed to measure tectonic activity off the coast of Oregon.</p>
                <p>This year the Purdue team, Edison Submersibles (formerly Aperture Aquatics), has built an ROV that is capable of completing the mission in the shortest amount of time. With greater access to machining shops and funding, the team was able to machine all the custom-designed ROV components to the necessary high standards. This includes a lightweight, anodized aluminum frame and custom-designed waterproof enclosure for on-board electronics and pneumatic systems. With the vehicle's power board and control systems designed and mounted by the students, ROV Model N represents a logical successor to the team's legacy of power, sophistication, and performance. Perhaps most impressive is the fact that the team designed and constructed the vehicle from the ground up and in house, from the layout of the frame to the software, and including the design and layout of the circuit boards.</p>
                <p>The Purdue IEEE ROV Team would like to thank the Indiana Space Grant Consortium, the Purdue Office of the Provost, and SolidWorks Corporation for their support that makes our team competitive at the International Competition in Seattle, WA. With all the advancements the team has made over the past few years, and with a second place finish in 2012, Edison Submersibles sees this year as their shining chance to seize victory at last.</p>

                <h2 class="text-center">Purdue IEEE ROV Team earns 17th internationally and earns distinctions</h2><br>
                <h3 class="text-center">Underwater robotics team returns with awards under belt</h3>
                <p>The Purdue University IEEE ROV team competed this last week at the international level of the MATE (Marine Advanced Technology Education) Center International ROV Competition in Seattle, WA. The mission theme this year was cabled ocean observing systems. The mission proved to be especially challenging this year with no team at the university level achieving a perfect performance score (a feat that has not been accomplished since the Purdue team and two others did it two years ago). The team placed 17th in the world among many teams including The Ohio State University, Milwaukee School Of Engineering, University of New Hampshire, Arizona State, and teams from Egypt, Russia, Canada, China, Saudi Arabia, and the UK!</p>
                <p>ROV Model N is the successor to the Purdue team's legacy of technological advancement. The onboard electrical system was custom designed and hand populated by the team. The mechanical construction of Model N reflects a simple yet robust design philosophy. She has many unique features such as her inverted electronics box that offers leak mitigation, her extremely high power-to-weight ratio, all-axis motion control, and a lightweight MIC 6 aluminum frame.</p>
                <p>This has been the 5th year for the Purdue IEEE ROV Team, a committee of the Purdue IEEE Student Branch. This year, the team has been awarded the Engineering Evaluation MVP Award for its top-notch ability to defend its design decisions in a logical manner. Normally awarded to an individual, the award was bestowed upon the entire team for how thoroughly its members knew the project and could address both technical and nontechnical questions. Additionally, the team received the Judges' Choice Award. For this prize, the competition judges select a team to represent the MATE Center at the prestigious Underwater Intervention conference in New Orleans February 11-13. The team is excited to present at this event and further its knowledge in field of marine technology. </p>
                <p>Thank you to all of those who have supported us throughout the last 5 years. The team is looking forward to start the adventure all over again next year with even more new members.</p>
                <p>Please forward to as many people as possible! Spread the word! Boiler Up!</p>
                <p>For a detailed description of our ROV, please see our <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/rtvcpaa4ao34bom/TechReport_2013_v3.pdf">technical report</a>.</p>

                <h2 class="text-center">Abstract and Awards</h2><br>
                <p>The Purdue IEEE ROV Team recently received 17th place in the 2013 MATE (Marine Advanced Technology Education) Center International ROV Competition in Seattle, Washington. For three years running, the team earned the Engineering Evaluation MVP Award, but in a distinct break from tradition, the entire team was honored instead of just an individual. The team is also excited to report that they will be submitting an abstract and giving a presentation at Underwater Intervention in New Orleans February 11-13, 2014 while representing the MATE Center as part of the Judges' Choice Award bestowed on them.</p>
                <p>For more information about the Marine Advanced Technology Education Center (MATE) Competition, please view their website <a href="http://www.marinetech.org">here</a>.</p>
                <p>Edison Submersibles, formerly Aperture Aquatics, designed and constructed ROV <em>Model N</em> to meet and exceed the requirements set forth by the 2013 MATE International ROV Competition. This includes installing the Scientific Interface Assembly and replacement Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, leveling the secondary node, and deploying a transmissometer to measure ocean turbidity. At 71 cm long, 69 cm wide, and 51 cm tall, ROV <em>Model N</em> is capable of performing all these tasks with peerless speed and maneuverability.</p>
                <p>Designed with reliability, stability, and speed in mind, ROV <em>Model N</em> is capable of maneuvering with six degrees of freedom. It has four thrusters for horizontal movement and four thrusters for vertical movement. The payload tools have been designed specifically for the mission and include a main gripper, turning motor leveling system, and spring-loaded measuring tool. All of the electronic hardware responsible for power management, vehicle movement, and sensor data collection, has been designed and fabricated from the ground up. The on-board and base station software was designed and developed by the company. Although it was a significant challenge to custom design electronic hardware, ROV <em>Model N</em> is fully functional.</p>
                <p>A full account of the functions and features of ROV <em>Model N</em> can be viewed in the technical report and in the engineering PowerPoint presentation.  These files can be found <a href="https://github.com/michaelhayashi/ROV_Model_N">here</a>, along with the hardware and software files.</p>
