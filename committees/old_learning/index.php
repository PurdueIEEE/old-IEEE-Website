                <p>The IEEE Learning Committee is dedicated to teaching any member the basics in Software, Hardware, and Mechanical concepts. These concepts vary from soldering, PCB design, JavaScript and Arduino Wiring programming, and 3D CAD modeling for 3D printing. The committee is structured in lessons that students participate in. Each lesson builds towards a final product that encompasses most if not all of the core skills that they will be learning.</p>
                <p>Anyone can join at any time!</p>
