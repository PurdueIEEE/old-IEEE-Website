                <h2>Technical Committees</h2>
                <p>The heart of IEEE lies with its committees. The six different committees of IEEE focus on a different subject matter and provide the technical experience to their members. Students learn valuable technical and managerial skills as they work on various projects. These hands-on skills go beyond the normal curriculum of lectures and laboratories. Technical achievements on each committee are recognized within IEEE, at various competitions, and in the engineering community. While the project scopes and team visions all differ substantially, all committees welcome students from all majors and years, from seniors in engineering and computer science to freshmen in management and the liberal arts. Though the committees may seem isolated from each other, all are part of the larger community of passionate students within IEEE.</p>
