            <p>
                Ivan Kouzmine is a senior in Computer Engineering and the lead developer of the ROV pilot software.
				Outside of that, he likes rebuilding PCs and learning lots of world languages with Japanese and German
				being the latest.
				Ivan has been a huge boost to the ROV team. He took over the front end this year and has done an
				excellent job integrating it with ros so it's easy to use. Ivan had compiled extensive documentation
				to create a tutorial for installing ROS. His work for the front end has also included a 3D model of
				the ROV with orientation, thruster visualization, and more.
