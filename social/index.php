                <h1>IEEE Social Committee</h1>
                <p>
                    The Social Committee of IEEE was founded back in 2016 with the goal to provide members
                    with fun and creative events.  Over its lifetime, it has hosted many events including
                    paintball and go karts.

                <h3>IEEE Day</h3>
                <p>
                    IEEE Day is the more important IEEE-themed holiday (the second is the IEEE Honor Ceremony
                    Day), held annually on the first Tuesday in October. It celebrates the first time in
                    history when engineers worldwide and IEEE members gathered to share their technical ideas
                    in 1884. For 2017, Purdue IEEE members squared off in a game of jeapordy about Purdue IEEE's technical committees.

                <h3>IEEE Grad Student Night</h3>
                <p>
                    Graduate students can be nearly invisible on campus, but IEEE certainly wants to give them
                    something to do this summer.  Come to Jake's Roadhouse on Wednesday, July 5th at 6:00 PM
                    to commiserate over the grad student life, find out if graduate school in ECE is a good
                    option for you, or hear from Dr. Joseph Rispoli about what it takes to graduate again.
                    Jake's trivia follows afterwards.

                <p>
                    An IEEE vs ASME paintball game was held at the Paintball Barn in Attica, IN on Saturday,
                    October 1st at 2:00 PM.  This was a highlight of the IEEE member experience that allows
                    members to vent some frustrations at committee leadership.

                <h3>IEEE Day 2016</h3>
                <p>
                    IEEE Day is the more important IEEE-themed holiday (the second is the IEEE Honor Ceremony
                    Day), held annually on the first Tuesday in October. It celebrates the first time in
                    history when engineers worldwide and IEEE members gathered to share their technical ideas
                    in 1884. For 2016, Purdue IEEE Student Branch celebrated by holding a relaxing game night
                    for the members with pizza and homemade cotton candy. Those in attendance enjoyed playing
                    games like Rocket League and Fibbage.

                <p>
                    The IEEE Social Committee tries to plan activities for members around during minor breaks.
                    Some IEEE members who were on campus during October Break took a trip to Cincinatti, OH to
                    visit Paramount Kings Island.

                <h3>IEEE vs. HKN Flag Football Game and BBQ</h3>
                <p>
                    The Nice Guys of Eta Kappa Nu Beta Chapter and the members of Purdue Univ-West Lafayette
                    IEEE Student Branch have a traditional game of flag football held once a year in which the
                    winner takes home a trophy made from a gigantic hard drive. The 2016 match took place in
                    Picket Park on November 6th. Despite a well-contested match, HKN takes the trophy home
                    again. In a show of unity, both teams joined each other for a barbebue with s'mores.

                <h3>Game and Pizza Night</h3>
                <p>
                    Twenty-five friends and acquaintences in IEEE gathered on January 22nd, 2017 to play video
                    games, challenge each other in board games, and eat pizza on a Sunday when the dining
                    courts were closed.

                <p>
                    A few friends in IEEE drove down to the ice skating rink on Saturday, February 4th, 2017.
                    A life behind textbooks might cause some mild muscle soreness when heading out on the ice.

                <h3>Go-Karting Trip</h3>
                <p>
                    When school starts going by too fast, that means it is time to gear up for a race against
                    fellow members on the track. A few members went down to Fastimes Indoor Karting, a track
                    with performance go-karts with top speeds of 40 mph, in Indianapolis on April 1st, 2017.
                    After a couple races, it was time for lunch at the nearby Steak 'n Shake.

                <h3>Ice Cream Social</h3>
                <p>
                    Ice cream certainly makes an IEEE General Assembly better.  After technical committees
                    spent the day in the MSEE Atrium showing off their accomplishments for the year, the whole
                    IEEE membership gathered in EE 129 on the night of April 4th to look back on how far they
                    have come over the course of the year and share memories with each other.
                </p>

                <h3>Spring Picnic</h3>
                <p>
                    IEEE hosted a final picnic with free food on April 21st, 2017
                    as a way to keep calm as Dead Week loomed in the week ahead.

                <p>
                    Regular screenings of older films were hosted multiple times a month on campus and in
                    member residences. Members gathered for outings to the local theater when current
                    blockbusters were playing. Movie selections and watch times were decided by conversing
                    with other members on #social and other channels on the Purdue IEEE Slack.
                </p>

                <h3>Exercise Groups</h3>
                <p>
                    Some members liked gathering for night runs, rock climbing, and other activities to stay fit.
                    Times and groups were formed by conversing with other members on #social and other channels on
                    the Purdue IEEE Slack.
