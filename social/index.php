                <p>
                    The Social Committee of IEEE was founded back in 2016 with the goal to provide members with fun and
                creative events. Over its lifetime, it has hosted many events including paintball and go karts.

                <br>
                <h4>Graduate students can be nearly invisible on campus, but IEEE certainly wants to give them something to do this summer. Come to Jake's Roadhouse on Wednesday, July 5th at 6:00 PM to commiserate over the grad student life, find out if graduate school in ECE is a good option for you, or hear from Dr. Joseph Rispoli about what it takes to graduate again. Jake's trivia follows afterwards.</h4>
