                <p>The Purdue University chapter of the IEEE is a student organization devoted to technical achievements and social events with a lot of history. The Purdue IEEE started in 1903 as the Purdue chapter of the AIEE (American Institute of Electrical Engineers), and became the Purdue chapter of the IEEE when the AIEE merged with the IRE (Institute of Radio Engineers) to form the IEEE. The IEEE, nationally, is the largest technical organization in the world, with 400,000 members in 160 countries. The Purdue chapter of the IEEE is split into several committees. Each committee is focused on a different goal, but all of them strive to further their technical achievements. The committees are described in more detail on their individual <a href="/technical/">committee pages</a>, along with news and information about themselves. In addition to the technical aspects, we are also a social organization. We hold events for our members to meet and greet each other and members of other organizations. We also have many networking opportunities through other members and through our relations with various groups and companies in industry. We are constantly trying to improve these relations. The Purdue IEEE Computer Society used to be a separate organization following a schism between its leadership and the IEEE officers on September 26, 1996, but they have been reunited with us since October 11, 2013.</p>
