            <p class="text-justify">
                This year has been an exciting year for MTT-S! In addition to working on the power amplifier and
                wireless harvester to prepare for IMS (International Microwave Symposium), we worked on an
                electromagnetically powered projectile launcher. This involved three main tasks including circuit
                design, mechanical design, and CAD design. We also worked on a FM radio workshop where we designed PCB
                and worked with radio signal logics to make personal FM radios. This summer, we plan to travel to
                Boston, Massachusetts to compete in IMS. We expect to do great at IMS and have a ton of fun!

            <!--<p class="text-justify">Purdue IEEE MTT-S spent its first year following its union with Purdue IEEE Student Branch focusing on how microwave radiation is used to bring Internet access to people. Many technical meetings were held to introduce members to the basic ideas and applications of high-frequency electromagnetics. The culmination of these meetings was a WiFi Workshop that explained how residential Internet service works, the hardware and software basics of IEEE 802.11, and how microwaves make the WLAN. Members went on to build a cantenna (pictured below), a cost-effective device that boosts WiFi signal strength. Commercial antennas were also used to compare the ability to establish a line-of-sight Internet link.</p>-->

            <p class="text-justify">Purdue IEEE MTT-S spent the year focusing on competing for a second time in a row at the area's largest conference, IMS (International Microwave Symposium), in their student design competitions. Moreover, the officers as well as some of the more-involved members spent the fall semester developing a workshop for an FM transmitter. This included tasks such as circuit design, PCB layout, and documentation. Every Thursday, members learned about various topics such as classes of power amplifiers, modulation schemes, and RF front end components. Knowledge gained on these topics will help out as the club prepares to compete in the IMS student design competitions next summer.
