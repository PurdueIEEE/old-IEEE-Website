			<p class="text-justify">Purdue IEEE MTT-S spent its first year following its union with Purdue IEEE Student Branch focusing on how microwave radiation is used to bring Internet access to people. Many technical meetings were held to introduce members to the basic ideas and applications of high-frequency electromagnetics. The culmination of these meetings was a WiFi Workshop that explained how residential Internet service works, the hardware and software basics of IEEE 802.11, and how microwaves make the WLAN. Members went on to build a cantenna (pictured below), a cost-effective device that boosts WiFi signal strength. Commercial antennas were also used to compare the ability to establish a line-of-sight Internet link.</p>
