<p>Over the next few weeks we have several learning workshops planned. Below are the summaries of what they will be teaching. Extra information for times, dates and contact info are on the <a href="/learning/">learning workshops page</a>. Be sure to check it out, as some workshops have extra instructions that need to be completed beforehand!</p>

<strong>Git and Github Training Session</strong>
<p>This session will cover the basics of using git and GitHub. Git is a version control software that makes saving your old code and reverting changes much easier. GitHub is a remote location to store your code and collaborate with other people through merging and code reviews. The session will cover only command line tools, so familiarity with the command line is helpful. Will be held on Friday, September 30th at 6:00 pm in Physics 223. This is the session for ECE students to attend.</p>

<strong>EAGLE Training Session</strong>
<p>This training session will cover the basics of EAGLE, an electrical board schematic and layout tool. The training session is split into three parts, that will teach how to create schematics, board layouts, and parts. No prior knowledge is required. The first session will be held this Thursday, in Physics 203 at 6:30 PM.</p>

<strong>SolidWorks Training Session</strong>
<p>Learn the basics of 3D modeling with one of the most widely utilized softwareâ€™s in industry, SolidWorks! This introductory series will cover basic parametric modeling with a focus on best practices so that you can create better, more robust models. The training session is split into three parts, with the first session being held this Wednesday, in Physics 022 at 6:30 PM.</p>

<strong>CATIA Training Session</strong>
<p>This training session will provide a basic overview of CATIA, a CAD software often used in the automotive, aerospace, and other heavy industries. We will delve into the basics of the software, so that members can become familiar with the software and gain a greater understanding of CAD in general. No prior knowledge is necessary. A few take-home projects will be given.</p>

<strong>Introduction to Microcontrollers</strong>
<p>This training session will go over the basics of microcontrollers. It will go into the basics of writing code to work for Arduinos, what you can and can't do with an Arduino, and how to set up different hardware to connect devices to your Arduino.</p>
