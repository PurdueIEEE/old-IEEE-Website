<strong>EAGLE Training Session</strong>
<p>This training session will cover the basics of EAGLE, an electrical board schematic and layout tool. The training session is split into three parts, that will teach how to create schematics, board layouts, and parts. No prior knowledge is required. The first session will be held this Thursday, in Physics 203 at 6:30 PM. Additional details below:</p>

<strong>SolidWorks Training Session</strong>
<p>Learn the basics of 3D modeling with one of the most widely utilized software’s in industry, SolidWorks! This introductory series will cover basic parametric modeling with a focus on best practices so that you can create better, more robust models. The training session is split into three parts, with the first session being held this Wednesday, in Physics 022 at 6:30 PM. Additional details below:</p>

<strong>Introduction to Planes</strong>
<p>This training session will introduce people to the basics of aerodynamics, common terminology, and basic configurations of planes and their pros and cons. In addition, a brief overview of RC systems is given. We will use the Aerial Robotic's kit planes and custom plane as reference. It will be an open session, so anyone is welcome to come. No prior knowledge is required.</p>

<strong>CATIA Training Session</strong>
<p>This training session will provide a basic overview of CATIA, a CAD software often used in the automotive, aerospace, and other heavy industries. We will delve into the basics of the software, so that members can become familiar with the software and gain a greater understanding of CAD in general. No prior knowledge is necessary. A few take-home projects will be given.</p>

<strong>Git + GitHub</strong>
<p>This session will cover the basics of using git and GitHub. Git is a version control software that makes saving your old code and reverting changes much easier. GitHub is a remote location to store your code and collaborate with other people through merging and code reviews. The session will cover only command line tools, so familiarity with the command line is helpful.</p>
