                <h4>President</h4>
                <p>Spencer Julian is a Senior in Computer Engineering at Purdue, entering his last semester. When he graduates, he will be working for Purdue full time, as a High Performance Computing administrator, working on some of the university's more high powered machines, such as Carter and Steele. In his spare time, he likes to watch foreign TV and play video games, and also builds small projects for fun. Spencer came to the IEEE through the IEEE Computer Society. 2 years ago, he entered the Computer Society, and he became president of it for the 2011-2012 school year. While President of the IEEE, he has already began improving the organization's outreach and social functions to the best of his ability, and has improved communication between different committees.</p>

                <h4>Vice President and Remotely Operated underwater Vehicle (ROV) Committee Chair</h4>
                <p>Growing up in the Caterpillar community of Peoria, IL, Michael has known he wanted to be an electrical engineer since childhood. He is a first-generation Boilermaker who loves the opportunities Purdue has given him. While maintaining a broad interest in electrical engineering, Michael's areas of interest lie with circuit design and microelectronics. Outside of academics, he enjoys reading, jogging, and video games. Michael first became active with IEEE in Spring 2012 through his participation on the ROV Team. Now in his second year at Purdue, Michael has devoted much of his time to activities within the local IEEE student branch. As Vice President, Michael is in charge of outreaching to schools and other organizations to promote Purdue Engineering and participation within the IEEE. Currently, the ROV Team is designing a vehicle to participate in the 2013 International MATE ROV Competition.</p>

                <h3>Daniel Klass</h3>
                <h4>Treasurer</h4>
                <p>Daniel is a Senior in Industrial Engineering with minors in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Statistics. After graduation, he started working at Texas Instruments in Richardson, TX. His main areas of interest are operations research and data science. The semiconductor industry provides quite the challenge with non-linear processes, unlike nearly all other industries, with one exception being website traffic flow. Python + Pandas development comprise his main area of expertise.</p>
                <p><em>Personal Statement</em>: One of my passions in life is making the world a better, more efficient place to advance our quality of life. Before the modern steam engine, human achievement was tied to population... essentially how much we could lift over our head. Following the steam engine's invention, we often let the machines do the heavy lifting and life became less tedious. I believe computing does the same thing for our minds that steam engines did for our bodies; it frees them to do what matters most: changing the world.</p>
