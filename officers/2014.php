                <h4>President</h4>
                <p>Matt is a Sophomore in Computer Science, one of few CS majors to have become President of Purdue IEEE Student Organization. Growing up in Joliet, IL, Matt has been working with robotics and computers since his involvement on his high school FIRST Robotics team. He is following the Systems Programming track in computer science. Outside of academics, he enjoys web development and video games. Matt had his first experience with IEEE during Summer 2013 before he had even started classes at Purdue. He was integral to developing the software on the ROV team, and has since risen to the role of Software Team Lead on the team. Now in his second year at Purdue, Matt has become extremely involved in all aspects of the student organization. In addition to his responsibilities as President and on the ROV team, he serves as the Computer Society Secretary. As President, Matt encourages the growth of the five committees, builds a strong network of motivated students, and pushes for wider involvement of all majors within IEEE.</p>
